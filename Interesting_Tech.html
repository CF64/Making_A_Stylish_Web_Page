         This webb page is about two technologies that I find most interesting, Self-Driving Cars and Artificial Intelligence(AI).
         I find them interesting because they have a direct impact our daliy lives and as they become increasingly common, they have
         the potential to make the world a better place. There are other interesting technologies that are emerging and have the
         potential to also make the world a better place but this two are my favourite.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would simply be introducing this technologies and some of their benefits. I know they are also cons about this technologies
        but I would only be focusing on thier pros as I am optimistic of the impact they would have and beacuse the pros outweigh the
        cons.

             <h2>What Are Self-Driving Cars?</h2>
             <p>
               Self-Driving Cars are cars or trucks which require no human control to be safely operated. They are also known as autonomous
               or driverless cars. They combine sensors, and software to control, navigate and drive the vehicle. Self-Driving technology is
               being developed by Google, Nvidia, BMW, Mercedes, Uber, Tesla, other major automakers, research and technology companies.
               Even though the technology is still in its infancy, it is becoming increasingly common with companies like GM and Nissan
               planning to deploy Self-Driving cars to the public in 2019. The flowing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaOB-ErYq6Y">video</a>
               shows a Self-Driving-Car in action.

                     <p>94 percent of serious accident serious crashes are due to human error. Self-Driving Cars have the potential to remove
                       human error from the equation and protect drivers and passengers, as well as bicyclist and pedestrians.

                     <p>
                      A NHTSA study showed motor vehicle crashes in 2010 cost $242 billion in economic activity, including $57.6 billion in
                      lost workplace productivity, and $594 billion due to loss of life and decreased quality of life due to injuries. Eliminating the vast majority of motor vehicle crashes could erase these costs.

             <p>
               Artificial Intelligence is the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition,
               decision-making, and translation between languages.The folowing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWmX3pd1f10">video</a> provides a good explanation of what Artificial Intelligence is
               Modern day examples of AI include:
             </p>
               <ul>
                 <li><b>Machine Learning</b>, which is the science of getting computers to learn without programing.</li>
                 <li><b>Robotics</b>a field of engineering focused on the design and manufacturing of robots.</li>
                 <li><b>Machine Vision</b>the process of making computers see by capturing and analyzing visual information using a camera, analog-to-digital conversion and digital signal processing.</li>
                 <li><b>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</b> the processing of human language by a computer program. NLP tasks include text translation and speech recognition.</li>
