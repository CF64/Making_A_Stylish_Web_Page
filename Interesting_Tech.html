         This webb page is about two technologies that I find most interesting, Self-Driving Cars and Artificial Intelligence(AI).
         I find them interesting because they have a direct impact our daliy lives and as they become increasingly common, they have
         the potential to make the world a better place. There are other interesting technologies that are emerging and have the
         potential to also make the world a better place but this two are my favourite.
         I would simply be introducing this technologies and some of their benefits. I know they are also cons about this technologies
         but I would only be focusing on thier pros as I am optimistic of the impact they would have and beacuse the pros outweigh the
         cons.

               Self-Driving Cars are cars or trucks which require no human control to be safely operated. They are also known as autonomous
               or driverless cars. They combine sensors, and software to control, navigate and drive the vehicle. Self-Driving technology is
               being developed by Google, Nvidia, BMW, Mercedes, Uber, Tesla, other major automakers, research and technology companies.
               Even though the technology is still in its infancy, it is becoming increasingly common with companies like GM and Nissan
               planning to deploy Self-Driving cars to the public in 2019. The flowing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaOB-ErYq6Y">video</a>
               shows a Self-Driving-Car in action.

                       <strong>Safety</strong>
                       <p>94 percent of serious accident serious crashes are due to human error. Self-Driving Cars have the potential to remove
                         human error from the equation and protect drivers and passengers, as well as bicyclist and pedestrians.

                       <strong>Economic and Societal Benefits</strong>
                       <p>
                        A NHTSA study showed motor vehicle crashes in 2010 cost $242 billion in economic activity, including $57.6 billion in
                        lost workplace productivity, and $594 billion due to loss of life and decreased quality of life due to injuries. Eliminating the vast majority of motor vehicle crashes could erase these costs.

                         Roads filled with automated vehicles could also cooperate to smooth traffic flow and reduce traffic congestion.

               Artificial Intelligence is the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition,
               decision-making, and translation between languages.The folowing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWmX3pd1f10">video</a> provides a good explanation of what Artificial Intelligence is
